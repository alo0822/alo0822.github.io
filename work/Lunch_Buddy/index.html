    <div class="work-body">
    	<p class="work-text" style="font-size: 1.3em;">Lunch Buddy is a social media mobile application that I started with a friend. We originally came up with the idea for an iOS development class. We haven't worked on this project for a while, but recently we have started to redesign the app.</p>

    	<p class="work-section-title">OVERVIEW</p>
    	<p class="work-text work-text-overview"><span style="font-family:LatoBold;padding-right:2px">What: </span> A social media mobile application</p>
      <p class="work-text work-text-overview"><span style="font-family:LatoBold;padding-right:2px">Goal: </span> Connect with friends in a fast and easy way</p>
    	<p class="work-text work-text-overview"><span style="font-family:LatoBold;padding-right:2px">Users: </span>College students</p>

      <p class="work-section-title">INSPIRATION</p>
      <p class="work-text">When my friend and I were trying to come up with an app idea, we wanted to create something that we would use ourselves. We thought about difficulties we had in our daily lives and how we could solve these with a phone application. We realized a problem that a lot of college students have is connecting with their friends, especially those attending large universities like UC Berkeley. At such a big university, it can be hard to maintain relationships and stay connected to your friends. It's often difficult to set up times to hang out that fit everyone's busy schedules, and sometimes you can go weeks or months without getting the chance to see someone.</p>
      <p class="work-text">From here, we came up with Lunch Buddy. Lunch Buddy provides a space for friends to connect with each other quickly and easily. Instead of constantly messaging all your friends to see if anyone is free for lunch, you can simply open your Lunch Buddy feed to see if any friends posted that they free, or quickly create an event and invite friends to come.</p>

      <p class="work-section-title">LOGO DESIGN</p>
      <p class="work-text">While creating the logo design, I wanted to incorporate the social aspects of the app.</p>
      <div class="work-img" style="width:200px">
        <img src="../../image/works/lb/lb-icon.png" />
        <i>Logo Design</i>
      </div>


      <p class="work-section-title">UI DESIGN</p>
      <p class="work-text">In the initial sketch, there are a total of five tabs. The home page is similar to a newsfeed and displays a list of current events. The second tab is a chat for users to message their friends directly in the app. The middle tab is the create event page. The fourth tab shows the notifications, such as invites and friend requests. The last tab is the user profile with the user's events, friend's list, and settings.</p>
      <div class="work-img">
        <img src="../../image/works/lb/lb-sketch.png" />
        <i>Initial sketches</i>
      </div>

      <p class="work-text">Before I made higher-fidelity mockups, I rethought the design and focus of the application. I decided that the home page should be a list of the user's current events and invites, so the user can quickly access the events they are a part of. </p>
      <div class="work-img" style="width:450px">
        <img src="../../image/works/lb/lb-screens.png" />
        <i>Higher-fidelity mockups for home screen and create event screen</i>
      </div>

      <p class="work-section-title">REDESIGN</p>
      <p class="work-text">Recently, I redesigned the application again. After taking the User Interaction course (CS160), I realized my previous design was a bit too complicated and not very user friendly. The main purpose of the app is to connect people quickly and see who's free and what they want to do. I went back to the idea that the home screen should be a feed, but with a simple design of who's free at what time for what activity.</p>
