      <p class="work-section-title">WHAT IS ALLY?</p>
      <p class="work-text">
        Ally is a smartphone and smartwatch application that allows Alzheimer's caregivers to monitor their patients
        or loved ones.
      </p>
      <p class="work-text">
        Ally delivers peace of mind to caregivers through patient location tracking and medication reminders delivered
        straight to the patient’s smartwatch. Patients are given a sense of autonomy: Ally allows patients to view
        visitor profiles and contact their caregivers through a simple, non-intrusive smartwatch app. It’s there when
        you need it, and out of the way when you don’t.
      </p>

      <p class="work-section-title">BRAINSTORM</p>
      <p class="work-text">
        Before creating Ally, we brainstormed over 50 different ideas for smartwatch-centric healthcare applications.
        What we found was that most ideas either boiled down to a stereotypical personal health and wellness app, or
        addressed only one generic problem. Initially, we found that our top three ideas were: </p>
        <ul style="margin-bottom:20px">
          <li class="work-text">
            A gym routine assistant that walks users through their workouts, tracking completed reps
          </li>
          <li class="work-text">
            A heart rate-based alarm clock that deactivates when a user reaches a target step count or heart rate.
          </li>
          <li class="work-text">
            A medication reminder app that tells you when to take and refill your prescriptions
          </li>
        </ul>
      <p class="work-text">
        We found that ideas were either gimmicky or already implemented. Our breakthrough moment happened when one of
        our team members mentioned that his grandfather suffers from Alzheimer’s and is cared for by his father. After
        hearing about the father’s struggles, we built on an idea that helps Alzheimer's patients remember the names of
        people who come to visit them.
      </p>

      <p class="work-section-title">CONTEXTUAL INQUIRY</p>
      <p class="work-text">
        We conducted several interviews at Berkeley Springs Manor, an assisted living home near downtown Berkeley,
        and also interviewed someone who is a caretaker for their family member. The goal was to gain insights
        about common difficulties that caregivers experience.
        After these interviews, we identified the top five user needs:
      </p>
      <ul style="margin-bottom:20px">
        <li class="work-text">Monitoring location</li>
        <li class="work-text">Recognizing caregivers</li>
        <li class="work-text">Remembering past actions</li>
        <li class="work-text">Being able to request assistance when lost</li>
        <li class="work-text">Patient comfort</li>
      </ul>

    	<p class="work-section-title">DESIGN</p>
      <p class="work-text">
        With the information we gathered from our interviews, we came up with Ally's three core functionalities:
      </p>
      <ul style="margin-bottom:20px">
        <li class="work-text">Track and monitor patient location</li>
        <li class="work-text">Push profiles to patient's smartwatch</li>
        <li class="work-text">Set reminders for patients</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="work-text">
        For our user interface design, we wanted to focus on the following:
      </p>

      <p class="work-section-title">ITERATION 1</p>
      <p class="work-text">
        With our core functionalities, we started with figuring out our application's workflow and how our users would
        interact with it. We made several initial sketches of how we envisioned the app.
      </p>
    	<div class="work-img" style="width:80%">
        <img src="image/works/ally/sketches.png" />
        <i>Initial sketches</i>
      </div>
      <p class="work-text">
        After evaluating of these sketches, we discussed it as a group and decided on changes including:
      </p>
      <ul style="margin-bottom:20px">
        <li class="work-text">
          <span style="font-family:LatoBold">Target live-at-home Alzheimer’s patients</span><br>
          We considered potential use cases such as professional caregivers with multiple patients with late-stage
          Alzheimer’s, and each situation comes with different needs for the caregivers. To most closely meet the needs of our
          application’s intended users, we narrowed down our target user group to live-at-home patients being cared for
          by a single caregiver.
        </li>
        <li class="work-text">
          <span style="font-family:LatoBold">Patient profile as the main screen</span><br>
          Initially, the home screen is a feed that shows the patient’s activity throughout the day for the case in
          which the caregiver has to care for multiple patients. After we decided to target early stage Alzheimer’s
          patients and their caregiver,the caregiver will only have to care for one Alzheimer’s patient. Therefore, it
          would be easier for the main screen to show the profile of the patient they are currently caring for.
        </li>
        <li class="work-text">
          <span style="font-family:LatoBold">Set up screen</span><br>
          We added a screen for users to set up the app with adding new patients and choosing which patient to connect
          to. The user can also return to this screen later to switch to another patient.
        </li>
        <li class="work-text">
          <span style="font-family:LatoBold">Emergency assistance as watch home screen</span><br>
          The emergency assistance screen is the only active interaction on the watch from the patient side, so we
          decided to have the emergency assistance screen be the home screen for the app to simplify the flow for the
          patient.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="work-section-title">ITERATION 2</p>
      <p class="work-text">
        Based on the initial sketches and the changes we discussed, we created the first iteration of wireframes.
      </p>
      <div class="work-img">
        <img src="image/works/ally/wireframe.png" />
        <i>First iteration wireframes</i>
      </div>
      <p class="work-text">
        We performed three user tests with the wireframes, and decided on the following changes based on
        our user feedback:
      </p>
      <ul style="margin-bottom:20px">
        <li class="work-text">
          <span style="font-family:LatoBold">Font needs to be thicker: </span>
          One of the concerns raised was the font was too thin, and would be harder to read on a smaller device
          especially for elderly patients.
        </li>
        <li class="work-text">
          <span style="font-family:LatoBold">Renaming the "People" tab: </span>
          There were two users who were confused by the "People" tab, and who the "people" were. We decided to rename
          this tab as "Visitors" to be clearer with the functionality of the tab.
        </li>
        <li class="work-text">
          <span style="font-family:LatoBold">Removing the "Edit" tab: </span>
          Users thought 4 tabs was a bit much and could cause confusion for first-time users of the app. As a result,
          we removed the "Edit" tab and added "Edit" as a menu item in the patient profile view.
        </li>
        <li class="work-text">
          <span style="font-family:LatoBold">Simplifying emergency assistance screens on smartwatch: </span>
          The 3-second help button and lost patient screens on the smartwatch were confusing for patients, so we
          simplified the screens by using less text as well as larger text.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="work-section-title">FINAL DESIGN</p>
      <p class="work-text">
        With feedback from the users, we wanted to focus on the following for our final design:
      </p>
      <ul style="margin-bottom:20px">
        <li class="work-text">Simple, intuitive user interface design</li>
        <li class="work-text">Maximize readability and accessibility of important information</li>
        <li class="work-text">Simplify watch face designs to minimize cognitive load for patients</li>
        <li class="work-text">Large buttons and text on watch faces to increase ease of use for patients</li>
      </ul>

        <img src="image/works/ally/final poster.jpg" />
        <i>Final poster for the showcase</i>
      </div>

      <p class="work-section-title">REFLECTION</p>
      <p class="work-text">
        While working on this project, one of the biggest technical challenges we encountered was a limitation in the
        Moto 360 hardware would require us to rethink our patient location feature. The Moto 360 can only communicate
        with the attached smartphone via Bluetooth, and so if the patient traveled beyond Bluetooth range, we would not
        be able to send location updates to the caregiver’s phone.<br><br>
        To work around this limitation, we utilized the low-level Bluetooth GATT (Generic Attribute Profile) Android
        API to regularly measure the strength of the signal between the watch and the phone. In addition to the patient
        wandering further away than the pre-defined distance, the signal becoming dangerously weak will trigger a
        warning to the caregiver.
      </p>
      <p class="work-text">Some future goals for Ally include: </p>
      <ul style="margin-bottom:20px">
        <li class="work-text">Watch detection for patient falling</li>
        <li class="work-text">Reminders notifications for caregivers</li>
        <li class="work-text">Push groups of visitors</li>
        <li class="work-text">Share patients among multiple caregivers</li>
      </ul>
